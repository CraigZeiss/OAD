## Guided Acquisition

### Key Facts

* **Run Overview Experiment**
* **Use Image Analysis to automatically detect "objects"**
* **Modify experiments based on those parameters**
* **Execute the modified experiment for all detected objects**

### General Workflow Description

For a growing number of applications, it will be crucial to acquire data in a smart way. One way to achieve this goal is to build a smart microscope, which essentially means creating smart software workflows to control the hardware based on image analysis results.

**Starting with ZEN blue 3.2 it will also be possible to train you own neural network for segmentation, [import it in ZEN](https://github.com/zeiss-microscopy/OAD/tree/39dbefaaaf4ede1492a4f9c8c12ea56f9b90cb0e/Machine_Learning#importing-externally-trained-networks-into-zen) and use it integrated into the Guided Acquisition workflow.**

#### Idea or Task:

* Scan or inspect a large area.
* Detect an "interesting" object or region using automated Image Analysis incl. Machine-Learning Segmentation.
* Acquire detailed data for every event.
* Automate the workflow to minimize user bias.

First of all it is important to define what a **Object of Interest** can actually be. Example would be an object that meets specific criteria, for example:

* Size
* Brightness
* Shape
* Intensity
* Combinations of the above

It could be something quite simple. For instance one can have lots of cells, that are stained with blue dye, and only a few of them (maybe where the transfection worked â€¦) are also expressing GFP.
The idea here would be to detect all cells that are positive for both colors and acquire an z-Stack for every cell that meets those criteria. Therefore this kind of application requires three major tasks:

* **Define the Overview Scan Experiment.**
* **Define the object detection rules, e.g. setup image analysis.**
* **Define the Detailed Scan(s) to be carried out in case of a "positive" object.**

### Main Workflow Description

* Acquire some sample data showing a object of interest.
* Setup an Image Analysis Pipeline to detect those events.
* Define an experiment which does the Overview Scan.
* Define an experiment which does the Detailed Scan.

The goal of this tutorial is to create an automated workflow that can be used to easily setup a **Guided Acquisition**. This requires some knowledge about the OAD macro environment and its **scripting language Python**.

#### UI for Guided Acquisition (ZEN blue module)

* easy-to-use, no need for scripting knowledge
* simple adding of post-processing function for the overview image
* built-in checks if the Image Analysis contains the required parameters
* easy handling of wellplate datasets

### Application Examples

#### Mitosis Detection using camera and LSM

An especially interesting option is to combine the power of a camera-based overview scan with the optional sectioning capabilities of an LSM. Such an workflow can be easily configured in ZEN Blue by setting up the respective experiment for the overview scan with camera detection using a low magnification and the LSM-based detail scan, e.g. Z-Stack, using a high NA objective.

Since ZEN Blue 2.5 this software has a module called **ZEN Connect**, which allows combining and correlating images inside one sample-centric workspace. Every acquired image by either the camera or the LSM) will be placed here based on the XY stage coordinates. Therefore the **Correlative Workspace (CWS)** is ideally suited to display the results of an Guided Acquisition workflow.

### Guided Acquisition Software Module in ZEN Blue

Starting with ZEN Blue 3.1 there will the option to purchase dedicated software module for Guided Acquisition, which has a streamlined UI interface and other additional functionality, like save settings.
